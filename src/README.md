# Bera Agent Kit Source Code

Welcome to the source code directory of the Bera Agent Kit. This folder contains the main codebase for the project.

## Directory Structure

The `src` directory is organized into several subdirectories, each responsible for different aspects of the Bera Agent Kit:

1. `ai-agents`: This directory contains the core AI agent functionality. It includes code for creating, handling, and performing runs with AI agents.
2. `constants`: Here you'll find constant values used throughout the project, including ABI files for different contracts and prompt templates.
3. `tools`: This directory houses various project interactions used by the AI agents. Each project has its own subdirectory with specific implementations.
4. `utils`: Utility functions and helper files that support the main functionality of the Bera Agent Kit are located here.

## Key Files

- `index.ts`: The main entry point for the Bera Agent Kit.

## Getting Started

To get started with development, we recommend familiarizing yourself with the contents of each subdirectory. The README files in each subdirectory provide more detailed information about their specific contents and usage.

## Contributing

When contributing to the Bera Agent Kit, please ensure that you place your code in the appropriate directory. If you're adding new project interactions, please create:
- new sub directory in `tools`
- new contract ABI in `constants`

## Questions and Support
